/**
 * Reassign commit authorship across all history.
 *
 * The third thing people need from history rewriting, after removing a file
 * and redacting a string: a contributor leaves and their identity has to come
 * off the commits — a personal email that should never have been public, an
 * account being closed, contributions consolidated onto one identity.
 *
 * Every commit, file and message is preserved exactly. Only the author and
 * committer identity changes, so `git log --stat` reads the same afterwards.
 *
 * Implemented with `git filter-repo --mailmap`, which is the supported path
 * for this: it rewrites author, committer AND tagger fields, and matches on
 * email, so a person who committed under several display names is caught by
 * one rule.
 *
 * ── Worth knowing before you run it ──────────────────────────────────────
 * This removes attribution. If the person holds copyright in the code, their
 * licence terms still apply regardless of what the commit metadata says —
 * rewriting the name does not transfer authorship in any legal sense.
 * It also only affects THIS copy: existing clones, forks and anything the
 * host has already cached keep the original identity until they re-clone.
